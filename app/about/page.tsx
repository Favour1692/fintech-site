              We're not done. In fact, we're just beginning. Our roadmap is shaped by one question: what do people really need from their money? From expanding our reach across Africa to launching new tools for investing, budgeting, and borderless
              payments, we're laying the groundwork for financial systems that are more open, more inclusive, and more personal. Your journey inspires ours. Watch this spaceâ€”we've got big things coming.
